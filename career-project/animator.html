        <!-- job description goes here: -->
        A traditional animator draws a series of images. Images are then taken to create the illusion of movement. People in this career are part storytellers, part illustrators, and part filmmakers. An average project has numerous stages. To start, animators come up with new concepts. Either they or a team could carry out this. They create storyboards next. These represent their ideas in pictorial form. They produce the visuals that will appear in the finished product when an idea has been chosen.

        Animators may draw by hand and scan the drawings into the computer for this process. Or they may use a computer to make the full animation. They can create intricate 3D models in this way. 
      </p>
      <p>These professionals then animate their pictures. Their projects range from being quite simple to being extremely sophisticated. Sometimes all they need to do is make a logo scroll over the screen. To animate 3D objects like dinosaurs and spacecraft, they could collaborate with a team.

        <h3>Education and Training</h3>

          <!-- place as many paragraphs as you need in this section -->
          If you want to get into digital animation, there are many paths you can take. The key to getting work in the field is to have a great demo reel. A post-secondary program in art or design will give you the skills to make one.</p>
<p>These programs last from 1 to 4 years. Depending on the program, you will earn a certificate, an associate degree, or a bachelor's degree. Many animators have a bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to choose a program that offers an internship. This will give you work experience in your area of focus. You'll also get many chances to develop your demo reel. Some major animation studios offer their own in-house training programs.</p>
